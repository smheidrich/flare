FLARE is an open-source Python package for creating fast and accurate atomistic potentials. Documentation of the code can be accessed here: https://flare.readthedocs.io/

## Major Features

* Gaussian Process Force Fields
  * 2- and 3-body multi-element kernels
  * Maximum likelihood hyperparameter optimization

* On-the-Fly Training
  * Coupling to Quantum Espresso, CP2K, and VASP DFT engines

* Mapped Gaussian Processes
  * Mapping to efficient cubic spline models

* ASE Interface
  * ASE calculator for GP models
  * On-the-fly training with ASE MD engines

* Module for training GPs from AIMD trajectories


## Prerequisites
1. To train a potential on the fly, you need a working installation of [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org) or [CP2K](https://www.cp2k.org).
2. FLARE requires Python 3 with the packages specified in `requirements.txt`. This is taken care of by `pip`.

## Installation
FLARE can be installed in two different ways.
1. Download and install automatically:
    ```
    pip install mir-flare
    ```
2. Download this repository and install (required for unit tests):
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mir-group/flare
    cd flare
    pip install .
    ```


## Tests
We recommend running unit tests to confirm that FLARE is running properly on your machine. We have implemented our tests using the pytest suite. You can call `pytest` from the command line in the tests directory to validate that Quantum ESPRESSO or CP2K are working correctly with FLARE.

Instructions (either DFT package will suffice):
```
pip install pytest
cd tests
PWSCF_COMMAND=/path/to/pw.x CP2K_COMMAND=/path/to/cp2k pytest
```
